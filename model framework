Key Components of  Model
1. Smart Infrastructure Setup
Connected Traffic Lights: Traffic signals that communicate with vehicles to optimize flow.
IoT-Enabled Road Sensors: Collect real-time data on congestion, road conditions, and pedestrian movement.
Smart Parking Systems: Vehicles can find and navigate to available parking spots.
2. Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) Communication
Traffic Light Coordination: Vehicles adjust speed based on upcoming signal changes.
Road Condition Alerts: Sensors detect hazards (e.g., potholes, accidents) and notify vehicles.
Dynamic Speed Limits: AI adjusts speed limits based on traffic density and weather.
3. Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) Communication
Collision Avoidance System: Vehicles share location and speed data to prevent accidents.
Platooning for Efficiency: Autonomous cars form groups to reduce congestion and save energy.
4. Data Processing & Decision-Making
Edge Computing with 5G: Reduces latency by processing data close to vehicles.
AI-Powered Traffic Predictions: Analyzes real-time traffic data to optimize routes.
Cloud-Based Control Center: Central hub managing city-wide transportation.
